        <p style="color: white;">
            I am currently a student of the University of North Alabama <a>"https://una.edu/">UNA website</a>
            Majoring in data analysis

            I tend to enjoy listening to others rather than talking and while I don't listen to music much my 
            favorite form of music is the type that uplifts people. I spend most of my free time either reading 
            or playing games. I have 1 sister who is older than me. Currently I have 5 pets, 1 horse and 4 cats 
            and I've been to San Fransico California, Miami Florida, and Alabama.
